I hate professor X's class on Economics as it made me incredibly anger and wanted to do angry things.
Economics 229 was the WORST class I've ever taken at Dartmouth; I wanted to smash my computer in to little pieces.
During the final of MATH332 I've never felt such a strong feeling of rage and aggression toward the professor.
Lingustics 1 made me incredibly anger and was one of the worst classes I've taken at Dartmouth due to the sheer amount of aggression I felt towards the professor;
My mind would fill with severe rage and anger due to the sheer unorganized nature of the teaching and homework assignments.
I've never been so full of rage during an office hour at Professor X's Physics class due to the sheer difficulty of the p-sets; I hate this class so much.
This class started off okay, but took a sheer turn for the worst as the psets became so difficult; I practically wanted to demolish my laptop as they filled me with so much anger.
NO NO NO!!! PowerPoints were often blatantly wrong. Students corrected him, and he often did not take the corrections. Skips office hours. Gave us no clue as to what is on the final. Sometimes gets mad when we ask questions.
If Whitfield is even allowed to teach another section of P13, DO NOT take this class. Lectures were disorganized, messy, and sometimes outright wrong; he would often change answers in the middle of class.
He was terrible at explaining concepts, and often embarrassed students who were confused to cover up for it. He had a bad attitude about being asked too many questions.

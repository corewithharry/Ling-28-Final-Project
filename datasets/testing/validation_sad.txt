Read as much as you can before class, take your time, and don't get behind.  you will die if you get behind.  and you will cry.  very hard.
Do not take this class if you are stupid.  It will end you.  It will make you depressed that all your friends at different schools do hardly anything for orgo while you labor through six hour labs.  You do come out of it with a "I just survived a disaster" mentality though.
On the last day of class she started crying because she really got to know us and was said that the term was over.  The class itself was not difficult and she is a fair grader.
I got really sad because we didn't have many problems of comparable difficulty to practice for the exams. Also, a ton of people dropped after the second exam, which made the median go up.  There were also people crying after the third exam.
The amount of work was so much that even ignoring my other two classes didn't give me enough time to complete the work.
I thought I was going to be able to breeze through this course and was sadly mistaken.
I hated it. so unorganized. so scattered. not informational and is probably the reason i decided not to be a major (sadly enough)  do yourself a favor and NEVER take this course. not even to fulfill a requirement.
It's sad to see him phasing out at Dartmouth, so take the class with him as soon as you can.  The problem sets were actually somewhat fun
if I could have avoided going, I would have, as we never went over grammar, just discussed things we had read which you could've gotten simply by doing the reading; sadly, the class had only 15 people so constant attendance was necessary
One time, I ran out of time, and turned in something that was not my best work. When we discussed it in class, it was pretty sad.

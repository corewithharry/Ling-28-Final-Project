The plays were really fun to read, so i would recommend the class, but I really couldn't deal with his lectures -- he's so passionate, but his way of speaking is like a performance in itself
Professor X really makes this class as good as it is. He is an INCREDIBLE lecturer. His lectures are really organized and easy to follow
This class was a great class. Prof X is an amazing lecturer perhaps one of the best in the college. The class was early in the morning but the material is so interesting and he is so good at presenting
The class is interesting, and the later two proffessors are wonderful, so make an effort to go to those classes - they add a lot to the material
I loved this class and Professor X had a really good and positive attitude toward teaching the students.
the class is really interesting and these four profs were EXCELLENT. but take this as an easy third class if you're good at multiple choice, because that's what determines your grade
I highly recommend this class. Readings are interesting, and the prof is hilarious. If you pay attention during lectures and get a hold of the concepts in the text, you should be fine
Definitely my favorite class at Dartmouth so far and maybe even my favorite class ever. It's a lot of textbook reading but I found most of it interesting, and the lectures are incredibly engaging
finally, a class I looked forward to attending!  even though it was in Filene, i never fell asleep.  lectures were lively and interesting, and i found myself thinking about and applying the readings many times outside of class
I am so thankful to have had professor X teaching this class! learning about Chinese was incredibly tough, but I loved this class so much!
